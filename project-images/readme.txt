The project-images folder is intended to house all image-format files which are:
	related to the Timeline project as a whole, but NOT utilized by some program like
	Android Studio. 

This folder should only contain image-format files, that is there should be no 
	project files or diagram files from programs used to create the image. 
	Only the final image.
